I'm Azadeh Bagheri. Like almost every child, I liked painting a lot during my childhood, but I fell in love with mathematics in high school! After some years, I got my degree in biomedical engineering and got a biomedical company job, but I still loved painting. At the same time, I started going to drawing classes. Those classes made me sure that I want to be a painter! So, I quit my job and registered for Visual Arts in the university entrance exam. Now I've got my master's degree in Visual Arts, and till now, I couldn't find any other work as enjoyable as painting and exploring through the Art world.
