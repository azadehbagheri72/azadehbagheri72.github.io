My name is Azadeh Bagheri (written as “_آزاده باقری_” in my native language-- Persian). I received my master degree in Visual Arts at the [Tehran University of Art](https://art.ac.ir/en). 
My master thesis is about _Qajar_’s painting alternation which is related to gender and sexuality discourse in _Qajar_ period. 

I am currently working with _Negah-e-fard_ Magazine. I am a member of editorial board and my job is to translate and write essays, reports and reviews for our online magazine.
